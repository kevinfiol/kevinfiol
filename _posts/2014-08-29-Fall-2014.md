title: Fall 2014
---

Since it's been nearly 7 months since my last blog post, I feel obliged to create another one. I've been busy since. Spring 2014 semester was long and strenuous. On top of classes, I was also looking for summer internship opportunities, and after much searching, I landed a spot with web hosting technology provider, Verio. It was both a difficult and rewarding summer to say the least; I balanced interning everyday with Calculus III and a course on Graphical Application Development using WinForms and XAML. The internship focused largely on SQL-related issues with legacy systems. I spent most of my time navigating with a Unix terminal, writing queries, and looking through Perl scripts.

Currently, I'm focusing on graduating this December with degrees in Computer Science and English with a concentration on British Literature. Four classes: Database Structures, Programming Languages, Formal Languages and Automata Theory, Game Programming, and a Senior Seminar to top it all off.

Oh man.
