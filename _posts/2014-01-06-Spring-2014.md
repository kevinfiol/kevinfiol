I'm taking a total five classes this semester. They are as followed:

Design and Analysis of Algorithms
Principles of Software Engineering
Stochastic Models
Computer Operating Systems
and lastly, Literary Theory
Lit Theory is my final class to complete my English Degree, which I'm very happy about. I like to think I've become a more effective writer, whether it be writing fun little stories, essays, or hey, blog posts.

In other news, I did fine last semester: AAAB+ & B. It seems I didn't know enough about Ovid's Metamorphoses or Calculus 2 as I thought I did.

I'm still working on the Steambytes project, but I definitely slowed down on it over the holidays. I did spend last night reading Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, however, and have a few more pages to go. Funny and poignant read.
