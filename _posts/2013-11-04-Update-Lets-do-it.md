title: Update? Let's do it.

I've never kept an active blog. Goes without saying this blog probably won't see much activity after this post. Regardless, I want to be able to tell myself something by writing it down. It gives that impression.

This blog was the first assignment of my Internet Computing class... well, kind of an assignment. More like a "extra" thing we could do for a couple of points. I had posted several resources beforehand that I think are great for learning on your own.

I've since linked this blog to my personal website which I am currently revamping in its own minimalist glory. Pretentious, I know, but despite never keeping an active blog, it seems strangely appropriate.
