Finals are almost done. I've finished three classes so far, and have two more to go. I should be studying for Data Structures, but instead I'm working on this Steam webapp using the Steam Web API. It grabs JSON data and sorts it neatly onto tables. It'll also let you know how much money your account is worth. Kind of nice but not unlike many other tools out there. I'm learning a lot though.

I haven't updated the site on the server yet, but I'm keeping everything on Github so I can also get used to using version control. Always learning, I guess.
