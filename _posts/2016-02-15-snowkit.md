>snowkit is a collective, a group of libraries, tools, and developers with a common set of goals toward a high quality ecosystem, for the Haxe toolkit.

I have recently began taking a look at alternatives to HaxeFlixel for lightweight game development. The reason for this is experimental nature of HaxeFlixel's HTML5 support, as well as snowkit's ability to export to WebGL. [Sven's](https://github.com/underscorediscovery) collective's philosophy encourages a centralized location for tutorials, projects, updates, and news. Check out [snowkit's gitter](https://gitter.im/snowkit/public/), for a searchable chat forum.
