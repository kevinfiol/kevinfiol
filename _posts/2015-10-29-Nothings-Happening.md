I've been working full-time for the past 10 months. I haven't updated in 9 months -- that's ridiculous, that's unacceptable. How can I get away with this?

My personal projects have taken an eternal halt. Inspiration has completely escaped me. I practice guitar on my freetime instead. I sing and play simple songs quietly in my room at night. I make sure to be extra quiet so no one can hear me and I won't embarrass myself.

I'll try to update again.
